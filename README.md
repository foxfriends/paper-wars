# Paper Wars

Build your own turn-based strategy game.

Inspired by [Age of Empires: The Age of Kings (DS)](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Empires:_The_Age_of_Kings)
and also [Fire Emblem](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Emblem_(series)), it should be possible to recreate stages
from these games (and more) using Paper Wars to bring your scenarios and stories to life.

## History

This is yet another attempt at the same project I have started many times in the past. See previous efforts
[1](https://github.com/foxfriends/definitely-not-fire-emblem),
[2](https://github.com/foxfriends/paper-wars-archive), and
[3](https://github.com/foxfriends/battlefield).
I think I lost some more too.
